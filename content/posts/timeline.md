On 12/12/12 Hawken was released to the world.

On 01/02/18 505/Reloaded turned off PC servers after forcefully backporting a broken console build to PC.

In December 2018 they removed Siege and Missile Assault from console servers. Shortly thereafter, voice was removed, destroying the console community.

And on 05/17/23, after 7 years of development and community neglect, 505 Games released into Early Access "Hawken Reborn", a soulless, empty single player game with a cash shop.

In doing so, they killed Hawken. It is clear that the development team is incapable of delivering anything that could even be called a Hawken clone and that management is intent on ignoring the community and squeezing the last drop of blood out of an IP they picked up in a bankruptcy sale.

Hawken now lives only in the hearts and memories of its pilots.
